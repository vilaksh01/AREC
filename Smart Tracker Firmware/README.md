# Smart Trackable Label
#### The smart tracking label is an unqiue way to make agricultural products transportation safer and free from counterfeits. With product traceability (localization and expected delivery date- information flow from farmer Bayer to customers), hardware-based traceability is much better than relying on humans. 
1. Provides product security, or anti-counterfeiting â€“ Making sure that the product is not forged/Copied and is an original Bayer product 
2. Almost impossible with our solution since Device ID is the only way to connect to the Blockchain ledger and no duplicates can persist, even if Device ID barcode is copied still it won't allow the device unless past track of it's logistics data is available

### Step 1: Physical Label Layout

Using the above layout provided me enough flexibility to cover a wider range of Bayer products, also to keep things simple only most relevant details for the farmers are placed on the label, for example.. farmers don't look to all details of the product like manufacturing process, company's info, etc. we should emphasize on those details which should not be missed. Since there's always an improved version of product from bayer for farmer that too can be covered in above layout.

### Step 2: Printing the physical label

I got the label printed on sticky paper to make first prototype
